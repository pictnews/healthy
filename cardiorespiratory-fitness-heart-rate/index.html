Cardiorespiratory fitness measures how well your heart and lungs work together to deliver oxygen to your muscles during exercise.

Your target heart rate is 50 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. Estimating cardiorespiratory fitness from heart rates both during and after stepping exercise: Knowing what types of exercise and how. Cardiorespiratory fitness, typically measured as peak oxygen uptake (v̇o 2peak) during maximal graded exercise testing (gxt max), is a predictor of morbidity, mortality, and cardiovascular disease.however, measuring v̇o 2peak is costly and inconvenient and thus not widely used in clinical settings.

<p>Alternatively, postexercise heart rate recovery (hrrec), which. Crf estimation models were developed using heart rate (hr) features extracted from the resting, exercise, and the recovery phase. The importance of v ˙ o 2 max as predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality has been recently highlighted by a scientific statement issued by the american heart association. Cardiorespiratory fitness, typically measured as peak oxygen uptake (v̇o 2peak) during maximal graded exercise testing (gxt max), is a predictor of morbidity, mortality, and cardiovascular disease.however, measuring v̇o 2peak is costly and inconvenient and thus not widely used in clinical settings.
