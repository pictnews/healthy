Diastolic heart failure, in which the left ventricle stiffens and bulks up, is different from systolic heart failure, in which the left ventricle becomes weak and flabby. The findings of this study are important because it indicates that sd is an important cause of mortality in patients with diastolic hf. In the final stage, when the heart is no longer capable of pumping enough blood to the body, dying from congestive heart failure is the result. This is very important to me to know, because i do not know much about diastolic heart failure.
