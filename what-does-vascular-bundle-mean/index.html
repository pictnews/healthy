Structure &amp; Classification of Vascular Bundles in Plants easybiologyclass From easybiologyclass.com
In open vascular bundles a layer of cambium will be present between the xylem and phloem and thus they shows secondary growth. Dicots have an open vascular bundle. Vascular bundles are a part of the transport system in vascular plants. What does vascular bundle mean?
